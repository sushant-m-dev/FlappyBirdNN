# Flappy-Bird-AI
Using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of augmenting topologies) genetic algorithm to teach neural networks to play Flappy Bird game

# Instructions

- To run the project, you need a configuration file for NEAT that specifies the parameters for the algorithm.

- Simply run the Project_1_Flappy_bird.py script and pass in the path to the configuration file as an argument.

- The script will then train the neural networks using NEAT and display a window showing the progress of the generations as the AI attempts to play the game
